## Introduction
Inconsistencies in active ingredients, excipients, the thickness and integrity of coatings and the presence of impurities in solid oral dosage forms all negatively affect their performance. Inferior quality attributes can be useful to identify off-brand or counterfeit products. There is a need for rapid and continuous analytical techniques that can assess and classify product differences of intact samples at- or near the production line, or in analytical labs, ideally without resorting to product dissolution [@doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2016.11.011]. Rapid measurement tools are particularly important to enable continuous monitoring, necessary to support the change from batch to continuous manufacturing. Analytical methods are required to monitor both the actives, coatings and consistency of the product: For example, in addition to the total API content, insight is also needed on degradation products, impurities, (co-) crystallinity/presence of polymorphs, and content uniformity. The ability to monitor tablet coating thickness and integrity is of great importance, particularly for functional coatings, such gastro-resistance, which would be compromised by insufficient thickness, or the occurrence of cracks in the film [@doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.01.062].
