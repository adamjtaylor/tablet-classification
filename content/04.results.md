### Acquisition of DESI-MS spectra from tablets

Rich mass spectra were rapidly obtained from each tablet type when held under the DESI sprayer and MS inlet capillary (Figure 1A). DESI-MS spectra from tablet types A and D are dominated by repeating polymeric peaks above *m/z* ~700, indicating the presence of a polymer film coating while spectra from tablet types B and C are less complex, being dominated by  peaks below *m/z* 700. The maximum intensity of the spectra collected in the absence of a tablet (“background”) is lower than for spectra where a tablet is presence. 

The polymeric peak sequences observed in tablet type A and D above *m/z* 700 are distinct from one another with several different peak sequences are observed (Figure 1B). Tablet types A and D both exhibit a clear sequence of peaks spaced by *m/z* ~44 the a signally charged unit difference from \[C~2~H~4~O]^+^. For both tablet types peaks above *m/z* 1000 are most intense. In tablet type A this predominantly consists of isotope clusters separated by *m/z* ~14.68, with peaks separated by *m/z* 0.33, indicating a 3+ charge state of the loss of \[C2H4O]. Conversely, in tablet type D the isotope clusters are separated by *m/z* ~11.01 with peak spacing of *m/z* ~0.25, indicating a 4+ charge state and the loss of \[C~2~H~4~O]. This indicates that while both are coated with a PEG-based polymer, the molecular weight or coating application may differ between the brand name and generic product. 

All three active ingredients were annotated from a mean spectrum within 15 ppm mass accuracy. Boxplots of single scan intensity show distinct differences in active intensity between types (Figure 1C, 1D, 1E). Caffeine is present in tablet types A, B and D and absent from type C. Median intensity is highest for the uncoated tablet type B. Intensity for tablet type C is similar to that in the background. While aspirin is present in tablet types A and D, the detected intensity in type B is high. This may represent an isobaric compound also present in type B or carry over from sampling tablet type A. Paracetamol is present in, and detected in all table types, although is most intense in tablets without a film-coating (types B and C) which may otherwise mask signal from the underlying bulk material. Variance for all actives and tablet types was high, indicating the need for consistent sampling procedures and robust classification approaches. 

### Acquisition of Transmission Raman spectra from tablets 

Mean transmission Raman spectra for each tablet type (Figure 1F) show very similar profiles for tablet types A and D (the film coated aspirin, paracetamol, and caffeine tablets) and between types B (paracetamol and caffeine and C (paracetamol only). Peaks characteristic of each active ingredient are observed (Caffeine: 555 cm^-1^, Paracetamol: 858 cm^-1^, Aspirin: 1192 cm^-1^) [@doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vibspec.2007.12.016; @doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics6040651; @doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2014.10.079]. However, no clear differences between tablets A and D were observed. As expected based on the tablet composition, the predominant spectral features relate to the actives rather than from the coating ingredients.
